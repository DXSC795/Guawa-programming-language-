Guawa language:powefull code in every bite 

_Syntax and Semantics_

- Consistent naming conventions: camelCase
- Simplified comments: `//` (single-line), `///` (multi-line)
- Indentation-based code block syntax with clear rules for scope

the lines starting with `?` are comments and are ignored by the Guawa interpreter

*Tab (or four spaces):*

In guawa, indentation (using tabs or four spaces) is used to denote block-level structure. This means that you need to indent your code to indicate where a block of code begins and ends.

*wave (~):*

In guawa, the wave (~) is used to indicate the start of a block of code. It's often used in conjunction with indentation to define the structure of your code
